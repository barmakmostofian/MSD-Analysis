# MSD-Analysis

This analysis derives the two-dimensional mean-square displacement (MSD) as a function of time intervals, \tau, and provides an uncertainty assessment at every \tau based on bootstrapping.  In particular, the input trajectories may not have constant time steps and the user can set the value of \tau as a command-line input, that is technically used as a binwidth to assign the given coordinates to a time interval.
